The data used to create the tidy dataset
----------------------------------------

To create the tidy **tidySamsungDF.txt** data set I used the row data obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0):

The **tidySamsungDF.txt** data set is the combination of two sets of row data: 

- training data set (70% of data), and 
- test data set (30% of data).

The training data set includes:

- `UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. This is an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- `UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt`: Training set.
- `UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt`: Training labels.

The test data set includes:
  
- `UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- `UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt`: Test set.
- `UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt`: Test labels.

The measured variable names were taken from:
  
- `UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt`: List of all features with time and frequency domain variables (1-561) that are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

The activity labels were taken from:
  
- `UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt`: Links the class labels with their activity name.

Files used as reference:
  
- `UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt`
- `UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt`: The information about the variables used on the feature vector.

Data transformations (steps performed to clean up the data)
----------------------------------------

The R libraries used to transform the data are: 

- **dplyr** (version 0.3.0.2)
- **plyr** (version 1.8.1) 
- **tidyr** (version 0.2.0)

**Step 1: Preparing data for cleaning.**

- Load the training/test observation sets, activity label IDs and subject IDs data into R using `read.table()`.
- Wrap the training/test observation sets and activity label IDs sets with `tbl_df()` (`package dplyr()`) for easy data manipulation.

**Step2: Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.**

- Combine training set with traning labels and subject IDs using `cbind()`.
- Combine test set with test labels and subject IDs using `cbind()`.
- Reshaping the combined training set using gather(by variable ID) and mutate(adding column "train").
- Reshaping the combined test set using gather(by variable ID) and mutate(adding column "test").
- Combine training and test sets together using `rbind_list()`.

**Step3. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**

The references for `mean()` and `std()` were taken from the `features_info.txt`, which comes together with the row data. 
- From `features.txt` data subset only variables that contain `mean` or `std` using `filter()` with `grep()`. The subset contains 66 feature names.
- Check this subset for duplicates using `filter()` with `duplicated()`. No duplicates were found.
- Reformat the `feature_id` column in the feature subset so that it can be matched with the `feature_id` column in the combined data set (from Step 2).
- Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the combined dataset based on the `feature_id` using `filter()` function.

**Step 4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.**

- Load activity labels with `read.table()`.
- The activity labels are already descriptive, but need some editing of the elements of the activity vector. Editing (or, fixing) of the character names is explained in *week 4 lecture 1* (last slide of "editingTextVariables"). 
- Make it lower case with `tolower()`.
- Make it `camelCase` using `mutate()` with `sub()`. 
- Join the fixed activity labels with the combined data set using `arrange()` with `join()` by activity label IDs.

**Step 5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.**

A "descrptive variable name" implies using a name that describes the meaning of the variable intuitively, for example, instead of `t` and `f` use `time` and `freq` (or, `frequency`). 

- Check if the feature subset has appropriate labeling. Check for errors (visually and/or programmatically) and edit it. 

The idea was to split the column containg feature names into 4 coumns each containing a relevant part for easy visualization. These 4 columns then were checked for errors by running `table()` and `R base` functions. The noticed discrepancies were: 1) not all names have X-Y-Z part; 2) some names contain duplicated parts.

- First, unify the format of the column containing feature names by adding NAs were X-Y-Z was missing.
- Add "-" simbol to separate the relevant parts of the string for easier spliting.
- Split the feature column into four columns using `strsplit()` and remove unnecessary simbols: `()` and `-`.
- After reshaping it into a data frame and applying `table()` it was easier to see were the discrepances are.

Comparing my unique feature names with the names descibed in the `feature_info.txt` document, I've got 3 extra variable names: `BodyBodyAccJerkMag`, `BodyBodyGyroJerkMag`, `BodyBodyGyroMag`, which has to be edited.

- Substitute `BodyBody` part with `Body` part using `sub()`.
- Using `mutate()` with `sub()` and `gsub()` remove `NAs`, `()`, `-`, replace `mean` with `Mean`, `std` with `Std`, `t` with `time` and `f` with `freq`.
- Finaly, join the appropriate descriptive variable names with the combined data set.

**Step 6. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**

- Summarise data (averaging) by `subject_id`, `activity` and `feature` using `ddply()`. 
- Spread the averaged variables to make the required tidy data set using `spread()` function.
- Save the data in a `.txt` format using `write.table()` with `row.name=FALSE`. The names of the saved file is `tidySamsungDF.txt`.
